## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Duolingo
   - Unique language learning material everyday at an appropriate level
   - Gamified language learning
   - keep track of friends

2. Google Maps
  - store restaurants and places to go to
  - see reviews of previous individuals' experiences
3. Meetup
  - find new meetups with people with similar interests
  - explore new groups and meet like minded people
  - can search in local areas
4. Spotify
  - discover new music
  - see related music to current song
App Idea:
An app to keep track of exercise milestones, plans, progress.

The app also keeps track of condition symptoms, especially concussions.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Connecting the app to github was challenging as I had conflicts between the local version and the remote repository. 
I also had trouble connecting the actions of the buttion to the controller.
